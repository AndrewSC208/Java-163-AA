// chapter 10 notes
// learning about inheritance:
  // inheritance: is the idea that once class can assume the attributes and behavior of another class
  // referrer to example 10-1 employee:
  
   // after you create the employee class you can create objects like these
   employee10_1 receptionist = new employee10_1();
   employee10_1 deliveryPerson = new employee10_1();
   
   // let's say that you need to extend the employee class and make an employee with a territory code.

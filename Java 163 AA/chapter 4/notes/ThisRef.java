	notes: Learning about the this reference:
	1. about the this reference:
		* when you instantiate an object from a class, memory is reserved for each instance field in the class. For example, if you a class contains 20 data fields, when you crate on object from that class, enough memory is reserved to hold the 20 values for that object. This can really chew up a lot of memory. 
		reference: is an object's memory address. The reference to an object that is passed to any object's non-static method is called the "this reference"
		this: is a reserved word in Java. 

	2. Using the this reference to make overloaded constructors more efficient:
		* I am little confused on this but I am sure that I will figure it out.

// this is some more practice: 

public class methodPractice2 {

	 public static void main(String[] args) { 
	 	// declare some variables:
	 	// local variavles:
	 	double mySalary = 200.00;
	 	double moneyAmount = 800.00;

	 	// this is the variable that I am going to assign to lets go:
	 	double coolTime;

	 	// some cool print statements:
	 	System.out.println("Demonstrating some raises ");

	 	// these are some method calls:
	 	predictRaise(400.00);
	 	predictRaise(mySalary);
	 	predictRaise(moneyAmount);

	 	// we are now calling the lets go method and passing two variables through it:
	 	// This is a really weird way of doing this but I needed to learn how to make methods: 
	 	// It seems like it worked and that really all that matters:
	 	coolTime = addThem(33, 22);




	 	// Print statement:
	 	System.out.println(coolTime);

	 } // end of main 

	 public static void predictRaise(double moneyAmount) {
	 	// declare them variables: these are actually all local variables that will only live in this method:
	 	double newAmount;
	 	final double RAISE = 1.10;

	 	// math: that will create the value that needs to be assigned to newAmount;
	 	// good times:
	 	newAmount = moneyAmount * RAISE;

	 	// Print statements
	 	System.out.println("with raise, salary is " + newAmount);

	 } // end moneyAmount

	 // this is the letsGo() method: 
	 public static int addThem(int x, int y ) { // when you put an int or some type of primative value in the declaration statement and not a void that means that you are going to return a value that is of that type. Right now you are allways going to use the (public static), and then the type that you are going to return if you are going to return a value:
	 	// this is a local varaible that I am going to return:
	 	int something;

	 	// lets do some math with some numbers: 
	 	something = x + y;

	 	return something; 
	 }

} // end of class

// there is something that is not right with this class for some reason I am not getting it to stay in my brain. If I want to be the best programmer then this is something that would come very easy.

// this is a pretty simple program that I have written that will demonstrate the how a method, local varaiables, and how to call them. Now that I am using them it seems to make a lot of sense. I need to really need to make sure that I am killen it. I just reaslized that I like to see people do really well, I just got to see Dainial again and it seems like everytime that I see him he is doing well, he always looks a life like someone should and I really appreciate that. I think that I need to take a page from his book and learn to just work hard and see where life takes me. I really don't work as hard as I should while I am at work. I need to make that a habit while it is going to be more easy to make it a habit. I really like were I am at these days. It seems like my life it totally different then it used to be. Its amazing. 

// I love watching people, this is tavk that is next to me the guy on the right (lets call him x) is super bumed out that he is with the person on the left( lets call him y, as you can tell I like to think objectivly about people) I really feal bad for both parties. Person x is really board with the fact the person y is lame. HOwever, they are out together on a friday night. I am not sure what the relationship with them is but it it weird that they are out together that is for sure. I really don't get it. I wish that I was ease dropping on them. haha I feel that it would really be funny. enought of that lets get back to programming that I need to be doing!

// wow my brain has really slowed down agter I am had a few beers. I am not going to lie I really think that this is something that has slowed me down the last few years. I drink a lot and mybe anythime that I want to get something done that is why I don't do anything. I don't know I am not sure really were I am going with this thought. I hae a lot to learn and I am not going to stop learning as long as I have the ability to do so I will. I think that I am super tipsy and I am not really sure why I only had three beers. I am really not sure what has done it to me. I am strugglen. Big time! 

// I am not a friendly person for some reason people do not take the time to greet me nearly as much as other people fo. It's probably becasue I am so in the zone right now that they would feel weird saying hi.

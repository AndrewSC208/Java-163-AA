/* Learning about class concepts: 

	Notes:
	
	I. Object-oriented thinking:
		1. When you think in a object oriented manner, everything is an object, and every object is a member of a class. 
			a. you can think of any inanimate physical item as an object -- your desk, computer, and building you live in. 
			b. events are also considered objects: buying a car, selling stock. 
		2. Everything is an object and every object is a member of a more general class.
			a. your desk is a member of the class that includes all desks. 
				i. an object oriented programmer would say that your desk is an instance of the desk class.
				ii. These statements represent is-a relationships-- that is, relationships in which the object "is a" concrete example of the class.
					Example: expressing an is-a relationship correctly your would say: "My oak desk with the scratch on top is a Desk"
			b. and Object is an instantiation of a class, or one tangible example of a class. 
			c. You will often use classes that someone else has written.
				i. You can call an application or class that instantiates objects of another pre-written class a class client or class user.
